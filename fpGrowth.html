(Han et al. 2000) is that implemented by the author of this WWW page, i.e. it 
is not identical to that first produced by Jiawei Han, Jian Pet, Yiwen Yin and 
Runying Mao, but certainly displays all the "salient" features of the FP-growth 
algorithm.</P>

<P>The popular FP-growth Association Rule Mining (ARM) algorirthm (Han et al. 
2000) is applied to a particular kind of set enumerationj tree, the FP-tree,
alsp developped by Han et al. Both the FP-tree and the FP-growth algorithm are
described in the following two sections. A short critique is also provided in
Section 3.</P> 

<P>The essential difference between the original FP-growth algorithm and the
LUCS-KDD (Java) implementation is that a second tree structure, the T-tree
(developped by Frans Coenen, Paul Leng and Graham Goulbourne) is used to store
the discovered frequent itemsets and subsequently generate the desired ARs.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>A popular "preprocessing" tree structure is the FP-tree proposed by Han et 
al. (2000). The FP-tree stores a single item (attribute) at each node, and 
includes additional links to facilitate 
processing. These links start from a <I>header table</I> and link together 
all nodes in the FP-tree which store the same "label", i.e. item.</P> 

<P>To illustrate the method, considering the simple data set:</P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD><TT>{1, 3, 4}</TT></TD>
<TR><TD><TT>{2, 4, 5}</TT></TD>
<TR><TD><TT>{2, 4, 6}</TT></TD>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
 
<P>The construction process begins with an initial pass to count support for 
the single items. Those that fail to meet the support threshold are eliminated, 
and the others ordered by decreasing frequency. For our illustration we will 
assume that all 1-itemsets are adequately supported, 
so the ordering will be <TT>{4,2,1,3,5,6}</TT>. We then pass through the 
dataset a second time and produce an initial FP-tree. We commence by reading 
the first record in the dataset and place this in the FP-tree 
(Figure 1(a) --- note the links from the header table). We then 
add the second record; the first element of this is common with an existing 
node and so we add the new node to the FP-tree structure as shown in 
Figure 1(b). We then add the last record 
(Figure 1(c)) to complete the initial FP-tree.</P>

<TR><TD><H2><font color = "white">3. THE FP-GROWTH ALGORITHM</font></H2></TD>
</TABLE>

<P>The algorithm, FP-growth, for mining the FP-tree structure is a recursive 
procedure during which many sub FP-trees and header tables are created. The 
process commences by examining each item in the header table, starting with 
the least frequent. For each entry the support value for the item is produced 
by following the links connecting all occurrences of the current item in the 
FP-tree. If the item is adequately supported, then for each leaf node 
a set of <I>ancestor labels</I> is produced (stored in a <I>prefix tree</I>), 
each of which has a support equivalent to the sum of the leaf node items from 
which
it is generated. If the set of ancestor labels is not <TT>null</TT>, a new tree 
is generated with the set of ancestor labels as the dataset, and the process 
repeated. In our implementation all frequent itemsets thus discovered were 
placed in a T-tree, thus providing fast access during the final stage of the 
ARM process, while at the same time providing for the deletion of FP-subtrees 
and tables created "on route" as the FP-growth algorithm progressed.</P> 

<P>For example in Figure 1(c) we would start with attribute <TT>6</TT>. This 
has a support of 1, and assuming this is above the required suppoprt threshold, 
this would be identified as a frequent set. There are two ancester labels so a 
new FP-tree is created (Figure 2(a)) using the ancestor labels as the input set 
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `('
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: `new FP-tree is created (Figure 2(a)) using the ancestor labels as the input set '

(note that the support values for the label are equivalent to the leaf node).
FP growth is applied again and the frequent sets <TT>{2,6}</TT> discovered.
There are still ancestor nodes so another tree is produced (Figure 2(b)) and 
the process is continued until there are no more ancestor nodes 
(Figure 2(c)).</P>

<TR><TD><H2><font color = "white">4. NOTE ON THE LUCS-KDD IMPLEMENTATION</font></H2></TD>
</TABLE>

<P>The LUCS-KDD implementation of FP growth reorders and prunes the input data.
Reorders so that the most common single attributes appear first, and pruned so
that unsupported 1-itemsets are not included. The effect of this reordering and
pruning is to make the running of the code much more computationally efficient
(an advantage appropriate to all tree based ARM algorithms). Thus given an input
set of the form:</P>

<PRE>
{1 3 4}
{2 4 5}
{2 4 6}
</PRE>

<P>This would be reordered to give:</P>

<PRE>
{4 1 3}
{4 2 5}
{4 2 6}
</PRE>

<P>However, for the code to operate correctly itemset attributes must be
numbered sequentially. Thus some renumbering must take place:</P>

<PRE>
4 becomes 1
2 becomes (stays at) 2
1 becomes 3
3 becomes 5
5 becomes (stays at) 5
6 becomes (stays at) 6
</PRE>

<P>The input data now looks like this:</P>

<PRE>
{1 3 4}
{1 2 5}
{1 2 6}
</PRE>

<P>Running the code produces a tree of the form:

<PRE>
(1) 1:3 (ref to null)
(1.1) 2:2 (ref to null)
(1.1.1) 5:1 (ref to null)
(1.1.2) 6:1 (ref to null)
(1.2) 3:1 (ref to null)
(1.2.1) 4:1 (ref to null)
</PRE>

<P>Where given <TT>X:Y</TT>, <TT>X</TT> is the attribute number and <TT>Y</TT>
is the associated support. Reordering and pruning can be switched off by
removing (commenting out) the lines:<P>

<PRE>
newFPtree.idInputDataOrdering();
newFPtree.recastInputDataAndPruneUnsupportedAtts(); 
newFPtree.setNumOneItemSets();
</PRE>

<P>From the <TT>FPgrowthApp.java</TT> class in which case this would give
an FP tree of the form:</P>

<PRE>
(1) 1:1 (ref to null)
(1.1) 3:1 (ref to null)
(1.1.1) 4:1 (ref to null)
(2) 2:2 (ref to null)
(2.1) 4:2 (ref to 4:1)
(2.1.1) 5:1 (ref to null)
(2.1.2) 6:1 (ref to null)
</PRE>

<P>Note that this unordered tree contains more nodes than the ordered tree.</P>

<TR><TD><H2><font color = "white">5. CRITIQUE</font></H2></TD>
</TABLE>

<P>The advantages offered by algorithms such as FP-Growth (Han et al. 2000) are 
partly gained from the ordering process, which reduces the overall size of the 
input dataset (because unsupported single items are eliminated), and reduces 
processing time by allowing the most common items to be processed most
efficiently. The first advantage can also be realised by other ARM algorithms;
anything that reduces the overall size of the input dataset has a positive 
effect on mining efficiency. However, the advantage will only be significant 
given sparse datasets and/or high support thresholds, where many
1-itemsets are likely to be unsupported and therefore can be eliminated from 
the input dataset.</P> 

<P>It should also be noteed here that reordering of attributes in datasets according to the support counts for 
single items has a general benefit with respect to the computational 
efficiency of set enumeration trees in general.</P>

<P>The LUCS-KDD FP-growth software has been implemented in Java using the 
Java2 SDK(Software Development Kit) Version 1.4.0, which should therefore make 
it highly portable. The code does not require any special packages and thus can 
be compiled using a standard Java compiler:</p>

<pre>
javac *.java
</pre>

<BR>
<a NAME = "documentation">
<H3>6.2. Documentation</H3>

<P>The code can be documented using <I>Java Doc</I>. First create a directory
<TT>Documentation</TT> in which to place the resulting HTML pages and then 
type:</P>

<PRE>
javadoc -d Documentation/ *.java

</table><BR>

<p>When compiled the software can be invoked in the normal manner using the 
Java interpreter:</p>

<pre>
java APPLICATION_CLASS_FILE_NAME
</pre>

<p>If you are planning to process a very large data set it is a good idea to 
grab some extra memory. For example:</p>

<pre>
java -Xms600m -Xmx600m APPLICATION_CLASS_FILE_NAME
</pre>

<P>The input to the software, in all cases is a (space separated)
<I>binary valued</I> data set <TT>R</TT>. The set <TT>R</TT>
comprises a set of <TT>N</TT> records such that each record (<TT>r</TT>),
in turn, comprises a set of <I>attributes</I>. Thus:</P>

<PRE>
R  = {r | r = subset A}
</PRE>

<P>Where <TT>A</TT> is the set of available attributes. The value <TT>D</TT> is
then defined as:

<PRE>
D = |A|
</PRE>

<P>We then say that a particular data set has <TT>D</TT> <I>columns</I> and
<TT>N</TT> <I>rows</I>. A small example data sets might be as follows:</P>

<PRE>
1 2 3 6
1 4 5 7
1 3 4 6
1 2 6
1 2 3 4 5 7
</PRE>

<P>where, in this case, <TT>A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}</TT>. Note that 
attribute numbers are ordered sequentially commencing with the
number 1 (the value 0 has a special meaning). The input
file is included using a <TT>-F</TT> flag.</P>

<P>The program assumes support and confidence default threshold values of 20% 
and 80% respectively. However the user may enter their own thresholds using the 
<TT>-S</TT> and <TT>-C</TT> flags. Thresholds are expressed as percentages.</P>

<P>Some example invocations, using a discretized/ normalised Pima Indians 
data set (also <A HREF = "pima.D38.N768.C2.num">available</A> from this
site) and each of the three application classes provided by this WWW site, are
given below:</P>

<PRE>
java FPgrowthApp -Fpima.D38.N768.C2.num
java FPgrowthApp -Fpima.D38.N768.C2.num -S2.5
java FPgrowthApp -Fpima.D38.N768.C2.num -S1 -C90
</PRE>

<P>(note that the ordering of flags is not significant). The output from each
application is a set of ARs (ordered according to confidence) plus some
diagnostic information (run time, number of rules generated etc.). The example
application also outputs the FP-trees generated. By editting the application
source file (<TT>FPgrowthApp.java</TT>) these outputs can be removed or commented out. </P>
